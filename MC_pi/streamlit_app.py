In this case the number we converge on is the true value of Pi (I have added it as a \
grey horizantal line on the graph). Notice how spread out the estimations are \
at low orders of magnitude (small numbers such as 1, 10 or 100) and how at large \
estimations (1000 or more) you can barely distinguish individual points!")
